The s1.c file contains the server code while c1.c and c2.c are two clients for testing the simulatneous inputs given by two different clients. Make sure to run all three codes on separate terminals simultaneously for seeing the correct execution of the code. The output is the generation of a file called list.txt which would contain the student name received from client c1 using name.txt and then the corresponding student id received from client c2 using id.txt
